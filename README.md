# Welcome to Rayverse
[Rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) is a kickass R package created by [Tyler Morgan-Wall](https://twitter.com/tylermorganwall) for producing 2D and 3D data visualisations

I came across multiple pretty, inspiring visualisations made using this package, BUT there was no beginner friendly tutorial. I kept ranting about awesome folks not sharing their code (atleast tutorial ones with barebones)

I stumbled upon a `LinkedIn` post from [Abhishek](https://github.com/Abhishek7Nayak/rayshaderR_maps) where he followed [Spencer Schien's](https://spencerschien.info/) live coding [session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=zgFXVhmKNbU&feature=youtu.be) and tutorial repo](https://github.com/Pecners/kontur_rayshader_tutorial)

This repo is my attempt to throw myself to the `Rayverse` and create a population map viz for human population of Kerala
